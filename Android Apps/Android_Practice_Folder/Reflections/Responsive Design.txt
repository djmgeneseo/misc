LinearLayout
RelativeLayout
GridLayout

Most common: Frame Layout, Linear Layout, and Relative Layout.
- descend from ViewGroup class
- Frame is great for simple layouts, with a single view or list.
- Linear is great for stacking vertically or horizontally. Good for proportions.
- Relative is more complicated. Position relative to other views or boundaries of view

AdapterView controls how views are laid out
- Takes-in ListView or GridView; which is why it needs to be its own method. It can work with either view
- Recycling views is a just-on-time compiling method which avoids loading and keeping loaded unecessary views.
