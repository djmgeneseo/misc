SQL queries - a request for information. An operation that allows one to search the database for the information needed. Used to extract data from the database
	- Executed with the SELECT statement
		- can be more specific: 
			- FROM: indicates the table where the search will be made
			- WHERE: used to define rows, in which the search will be carried. All rows, for which the WHERE clause is not true, will be excluded
			- ORDER BY: the only way to sort the results in SQL. Otherwise, they will be returned in a random order.

		EX) SELECT * FROM
			WHERE active
			ORDER BY LastName, FirstName

- Tables are like Excel Sheets
- Normalization: separate into tables to reduce redundance 
- Relational database: relation between tables. 
	- Well designed databases enforces relationships that keeps data consistent and accurate

Primary Key (column of a table)
- Each table has its own primary key (column)
- Each row has its unique value of a primary (table) key
- Can use multiple columns as primary key for a table

Foreign Key (column of a table)
- A primary key from another table, used out of its table's context
- Must have same data type

One-to-many relationship
- One primary key can "own" multiple rows on another table that it's foreign to. (EX. A unique customer can make many orders)
