SQL queries - a request for information. An operation that allows one to search the database for the information needed. Used to extract data from the database
	- Executed with the SELECT statement
		- can be more specific: 
			- FROM: indicates the table where the search will be made
			- WHERE: used to define rows, in which the search will be carried. All rows, for which the WHERE clause is not true, will be excluded
			- ORDER BY: the only way to sort the results in SQL. Otherwise, they will be returned in a random order.

		EX) SELECT * FROM
			WHERE active
			ORDER BY LastName, FirstName
